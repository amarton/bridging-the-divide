“You are dividing races. You’re dividing everyone. That is not what we are here for...I am almost ashamed, but it had to be said. Do the right thing. It is about our children,"said Jeff Sanford, an African-American father of twin boys at Johnnycake Elementary School.


“It was like, they were fighting to keep what they got, and we were fighting to keep what we got, instead of us fighting to figure out how to make what we had better,” Sanford said.


“They are going to ruin Catonsville. Who gets to benefit from the new Catonsville Elementary School and Westowne Elementary?....Unbelievable.” Comment from Catonsville parent on Facebook page.


“I felt as though we didn’t live on that side of Catonsville,” Jeff Sanford said, “so they didn’t want us on that side of Catonsville.”


“It was easier for me than it would have been if I was black,” said Cara Detwiler, a white teacher at Johnnycake Elementary. “I didn’t have to worry about being the angry, black woman. Instead, I was just the naggy white woman. And that’s different.


“For all the same reasons people are afraid to go into neighborhoods were the same reasons people didn’t want Johnnycake. And it was very black and white," said Johnnycake Principal 
Bre-Anne Fortkamp.


“All they saw was a black man whose kids go to Johnnycake,” Sanford said. “They thought, ‘You’re black, I’m white, I can do things you can’t do.’ Maybe -- but your kids can’t do things my kids can.
I would put my two kids up against anybody on that side of 40.” 


“Honestly, it is hard to hold it against parents. They are looking at what is going to happen to my child, and not the greater good,” said Erica Mah, a Hillcrest parent. IS SHE WHITE OR BLACK?


“There is an overlap between race, poverty and childhood trauma. They have learning issues that lead to behavioral struggles, behavioral needs,” said Justine Stull, who is white and PTA president of Westowne Elementary. “We don’t want to talk about these things. They are too hard.”


“It was every man for himself," Donna Knutson, a black parent from Hillcrest.


“No, it’s because we’re black," said a fifth-grade African-American boy at Johnnycake Elementary.


“I was not prepared for that. Maybe, shame on me. As a parent, I understand that they felt they had their child’s best interest. I just didn’t think it would get so ugly,” said Johnnycake principal Bre-Anne Fortkamp, who is white.


"We decided we’d rather stay overcrowded - and have them be loved.”
